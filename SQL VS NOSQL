SQL vs NoSQL

SQL (Relational Databases)

SQL databases store data in tables with rows and columns, just like an Excel sheet.
They are best when data is structured and relationships are important.

Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle

NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)

NoSQL databases store data in a flexible format like JSON documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.
They are best when data is unstructured or changing frequently.

Examples: MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, DynamoDB

Key Differences (In Simple Words)
Feature	SQL	NoSQL
Data structure	Tables (fixed columns)	Flexible (JSON, key-value, etc.)
Schema	Fixed schema	Dynamic schema
Relationships	Strong relationships (joins)	Few or no joins
Scaling	Vertical (bigger server)	Horizontal (more servers)
Consistency	Very strong	Often flexible
Best for	Banking, ERP, CMS	Real-time apps, big data, analytics
Easy Example

SQL:
A banking system where data must be accurate and well-structured

NoSQL:
A chat app or social media app where data changes often and needs to scale fast

When to Use What

Use SQL when:

Data is structured

Relationships matter

Accuracy is critical

Use NoSQL when:

Data structure changes often

High traffic & fast scaling needed

Large volumes of data

One-line summary:

SQL = structured & reliable
NoSQL = flexible & scalable
