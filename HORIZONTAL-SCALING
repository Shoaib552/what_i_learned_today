Horizontal scaling means adding more copies of the same thing to handle more work.

Imagine you have one shopkeeper and many customers come.

The shopkeeper becomes slow because too many people are waiting.

So you add more shopkeepers doing the same job.

Now customers are served faster.

You did not make one shopkeeper stronger, you added more shopkeepers.

That is called horizontal scaling.

Example in computers:

A website has one server and many users open it.

The server becomes slow.

The company adds more servers running the same website.

A load balancer sends users to different servers.

Website stays fast even with many users.

How companies use it:

Netflix adds more servers when many people watch movies.

Amazon adds more servers during sales like Big Billion Day.

Uber adds more servers when many people book rides at the same time.

One-line interview answer:

Horizontal scaling means adding more servers or instances to handle more traffic instead of making one server bigger.
