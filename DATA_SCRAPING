Data Scraping Notes
1. What is Data Scraping

Data scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites or online sources.
It is commonly used to collect large batches of data for research, analysis, automation, or business intelligence.

2. How Data Scraping Works (Simple Explanation)

A program or script sends a request to a website.

The website returns HTML data.

The scraper reads the HTML and finds specific information you want.

The data is extracted and stored in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, or a database.

The scraper may follow multiple links to collect more data.

3. Methods of Data Scraping

Manual Copying

Very slow, only for small tasks.

Automated Scripts

Uses Python or other languages to automatically extract data.

API Scraping

Uses official APIs provided by websites to get structured data.

Browser Automation

Uses tools like Selenium to control a browser and extract dynamic content.

Headless Browsers

Uses tools like Puppeteer or Playwright to scrape JavaScript-heavy websites.

4. Things Required for Data Scraping

Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended).

Understanding of HTML, CSS, and website structure.

A scraping library such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, or Puppeteer.

Tools to store data like CSV, JSON, or databases.

A stable internet connection.

Optional: proxies and rotating user agents for avoiding blocks.

5. Important Things to Keep in Mind

Follow website rules

Always check the website’s robots.txt file and terms of service.

Avoid sending too many requests

Use delays between requests to avoid getting blocked.

Use headers and user agents

Helps scraper look like a normal user.

Handle CAPTCHAs

Some websites use CAPTCHAs to block scraping.

Dynamic websites

Websites using JavaScript require tools like Selenium or Puppeteer.

Respect ethical guidelines

Do not scrape private or sensitive user data.

Store data safely

Always clean and validate extracted data.

6. Famous Data Scraping Tools and Libraries

BeautifulSoup (Python)

Great for simple HTML parsing.

Scrapy (Python)

Very fast and powerful scraping framework.

Selenium (Python / JavaScript / others)

Automates browsers and handles dynamic content.

Puppeteer (JavaScript)

Headless Chrome automation.

Playwright (Python / JS)

More modern browser automation tool.

Cheerio (JavaScript)

Fast HTML parser for Node.js.

Octoparse

No-code visual scraper tool.

Apify

Cloud-based scraping and automation platform.

7. Why Data Scraping is Used

To collect product prices and compare markets.

To gather research or academic data.

To automate data collection tasks.

To monitor competitor websites.

To track public information like news or reviews.

To gather large datasets for machine learning.

8. Challenges in Data Scraping

Websites change structure often.

JavaScript-heavy websites are harder to scrape.

IP blocking and rate limiting.

Captchas and anti-bot systems.

Legal and ethical restrictions.

Managing cookies, sessions, and authentication.

9. Best Practices for Data Scraping

Always write scrapers that can handle errors.

Use request delays or throttling.

Use rotating proxies if scraping large-scale data.

Store data in structured formats.

Log every scraping step for debugging.

Use version control for scraper scripts.

10. Example Workflow for a Basic Scraper

Inspect page structure using browser developer tools.

Identify tags or classes that contain required data.

Write script using a library like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.

Extract fields such as title, price, or links.

Clean the extracted data.

Save it to CSV or a database.

Run the scraper regularly if continuous data is needed.
