In very simple words

React Native lets you make real mobile apps using React instead of Java/Kotlin or Swift.

You write code once → it runs on both Android and iOS 📱

How it works

You write React-style code

React Native converts it into real native UI components

Result: fast apps that feel like normal mobile apps

 It is not a website inside an app (not WebView).

React vs React Native
React (Web)	React Native (Mobile)
Builds websites	Builds mobile apps
Uses HTML, CSS	Uses native components
<div> <span>	<View> <Text>
Runs in browser	Runs on phone
Example
React (Web)
<div>Hello Shoaib</div>

React Native
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

<View>
  <Text>Hello Shoaib</Text>
</View>
