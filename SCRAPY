1. What is Scrapy

Scrapy is a fast, open-source web scraping framework written in Python.
It helps developers extract data from websites, process that data, and store it in different formats.

2. Why Scrapy is Used

To scrape large websites efficiently

To automate web data extraction

To crawl multiple pages quickly

To store extracted data in files or databases

To handle complex scraping tasks such as login, pagination, and dynamic URLs

3. Key Features of Scrapy

High-speed web crawling

Built-in system for handling requests and responses

Automatic data pipelines

Easy handling of links and pagination

Ability to export data in JSON, CSV, or XML

Middleware options to handle cookies, headers, and proxies

Supports asynchronous scraping (makes it extremely fast)

4. How Scrapy Works (Simple Explanation)

You create a "Spider" (a Python class).

The spider visits a website.

It extracts the data you want.

It follows links to other pages if needed.

It saves all the data into a file or database.

5. Main Components in Scrapy

Spider

The main file that defines how to visit pages and what data to extract.

Items

A structured container to store scraped data.

Pipelines

Used to clean, validate, or store data.

Downloader Middleware

Controls requests and responses (for headers, proxies, cookies).

Schedulers

Manages the order of URL requests.

6. Basic Command Workflow

Create a new Scrapy project

scrapy startproject projectname

Create a spider

scrapy genspider spidername example.com

Run the spider

scrapy crawl spidername

Export scraped data

scrapy crawl spidername -o data.json

7. Advantages of Scrapy

Fast and efficient

Supports asynchronous scraping

Easy to scale

Handles complex websites

Large community and documentation

8. Limitations of Scrapy

Not ideal for JavaScript-heavy websites

Requires Python knowledge

Takes time to learn compared to simple libraries like BeautifulSoup
