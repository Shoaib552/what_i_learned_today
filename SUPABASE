Supabase = A ready-made backend that stores your app’s data, handles users, and updates things in real-time, so you don’t have to build a server yourself.

Imagine you have a magic barn:

You put your stuff (data) in it — like carrots, hay, or your todo list.

You want your friends (users) to come and take or add stuff. Supabase gives you keys so only the right friends can enter.

Whenever something changes in the barn, everyone can see it instantly — no need to shout or run around.

You don’t have to build the barn yourself, it’s already built, strong, and ready to use.
