LLM (Large Language Model) is a very smart text predictor.

Think of it like a super-powered autocomplete that's read almost the entire internet. When you ask it something:

Learned from text: It has analyzed billions of pages, books, articles, and websites

Predicts what comes next: Based on patterns it learned, it guesses the most likely next words

Understands context: It can follow conversations, answer questions, write stories, etc.

Simple analogy: Imagine you've read every book in a library. If someone starts a sentence, you could finish it in many different ways based on what you've read. LLMs do this, but much faster and with more information.
