Kubernetes is a tool that takes care of your application.

Your application runs inside small boxes called containers.

Sometimes a container can stop or crash.

Kubernetes keeps checking if containers are running or not.

If one container stops, Kubernetes starts a new one automatically.

If many users open your app, Kubernetes creates more containers.

If users leave, Kubernetes removes extra containers.

You do not need to start or stop containers manually.

Kubernetes does all this work for you automatically.

This keeps your app fast, safe, and always available.

One-line interview answer:

Kubernetes is a tool that manages containers and keeps applications running smoothly.
