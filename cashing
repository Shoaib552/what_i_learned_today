Simple definition

Caching = saving frequently used data in a fast storage so you don’t have to recompute or fetch it again.

Real-life example

Imagine you go to a coffee shop every day ☕

First time → barista asks your order (slow)

Next time → barista remembers your order (fast)

That “remembering” is caching.

Technical example

Without caching:

User request → Database → Response (slow)


With caching:

User request → Cache → Response (fast)
                 ↓ (if not found)
               Database

Why caching is important

Faster response time

Less load on database / API

Better user experience

Saves server resources

Common places where caching is used
1. Browser caching

Images, CSS, JS stored in browser

Page loads faster next time

2. Backend caching

Redis / Memcached

Store DB query results

3. Application-level caching

Cache computed results (reports, analytics)

4. CDN caching

Cloudflare, Akamai

Cache content closer to users

Simple backend example (conceptual)
Request: Get user profile

Check cache:
  If exists → return cached data
  Else → fetch from DB → store in cache → return

Cache expiry (important concept)

Cached data is not permanent.

Examples:

Cache for 5 minutes

Cache until updated

Cache cleared manually

This avoids serving outdated data.

Very common interview line

“Caching trades memory for speed.”
