Vertical scaling means making one thing stronger, not adding more copies.

Imagine you have one shopkeeper and many customers come.

Instead of adding more shopkeepers, you make the shopkeeper faster and stronger.

You give him more energy so he can serve people quicker.

Still only one shopkeeper, just more powerful.

That is called vertical scaling.

Example in computers:

A website runs on one server.

Many users visit and the server becomes slow.

The company upgrades the same server.

They add more RAM, CPU, or storage.

Now the same server can handle more users.

How companies use it:

Small startups upgrade their server when traffic increases a little.

Banks use powerful servers for databases.

Companies upgrade servers instead of managing many servers.
