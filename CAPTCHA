1. What is CAPTCHA?

CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.

It is a security method used on websites to check whether the user is a real human or a bot.

Main purpose: Prevent automated abuse such as spam, fake sign-ups, brute-force attacks, and automated scraping.

2. Why CAPTCHA is Needed?

Stops bots from creating fake accounts.

Prevents bots from scraping sensitive website data.

Protects login systems from password guessing attacks.

Prevents automated form submissions (spam forms).

Helps websites maintain security and server stability.

3. Where CAPTCHA is Used?

Login pages

Registration pages

Forms (contact forms, feedback forms)

Comment sections

Checkout pages

High-security areas of websites

Anywhere bots may try to abuse the system

4. Types of CAPTCHA
4.1 Text-Based CAPTCHA

Shows distorted letters/numbers.

User must type what they see.

4.2 Image Recognition CAPTCHA

User selects images that match a prompt.

Example: “Select all squares with traffic lights.”

4.3 reCAPTCHA v2 (Checkbox)

The “I’m not a robot” checkbox.

Uses user behavior to decide if they are real.

4.4 Invisible reCAPTCHA

Runs in the background.

No user interaction needed unless suspicious.

4.5 reCAPTCHA v3

Gives a score based on user behavior (0 to 1).

Lower score = likely a bot.

4.6 Audio CAPTCHA

User listens to numbers/words and types them.

4.7 Math CAPTCHA

Simple math questions, e.g., “5 + 7 = ?”

4.8 Slider CAPTCHA

User drags a puzzle piece into the correct place.

5. How CAPTCHA Works?

It gives tasks that are difficult for bots but easy for humans.

Uses behavioral analysis:

Mouse movement

Click speed

Typing pattern

Browser characteristics

IP address reputation

Bot behavior is more predictable and easier to detect.

6. CAPTCHA and Data Scraping

Many websites use CAPTCHA to stop scrapers.

Scraping becomes difficult when CAPTCHA appears frequently.

Bots trigger CAPTCHA due to:

Fast requests

Multiple requests from same IP

No user behavior

Scripted browser actions

7. Techniques Used by Bots to Bypass CAPTCHA (Educational Only)

CAPTCHA-solving services (paid)

AI recognition models

Proxies and human-in-the-loop services

Browser automation tools
(Note: Actual bypassing on protected websites may violate terms. Always follow the law and policies.)

8. How Websites Detect Bots (CAPTCHA Triggers)

High request frequency

Repeated access from same IP

No mouse/keyboard activity

Scripted browser environment

Suspicious user agents

Countries/IPs with bad reputation

9. CAPTCHA Best Practices for Websites

Use stronger systems like reCAPTCHA v3

Show CAPTCHA only when needed

Combine with rate limiting

Allow alternative for disabled users (audio)

10. Advantages of CAPTCHA

Protects website from bots

Reduces spam

Stops automated attacks

Improves security

11. Disadvantages of CAPTCHA

Can frustrate users

Sometimes difficult to solve

Not accessible for all (visual issues)

Adds friction to user experience
