1. Introduction to Go

Go is an open-source programming language created by Google in 2009.

It is designed to be simple, fast, and safe for building reliable software.

It combines the performance of lower-level languages with the ease of higher-level languages.

It is mainly used for backend systems, networking tools, cloud applications, DevOps tools, and distributed systems.

2. Main Features of Go

Very fast compilation.

Built-in support for concurrency using goroutines.

Strong and static typing system.

Simple syntax and minimal keywords.

Garbage collection for automatic memory management.

Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows).

Built-in tooling such as go build, go test, go fmt, and go run.

3. Why Go Is Popular

Easy to learn and write.

Very high performance, close to C.

Excellent for microservices and backend APIs.

Highly optimized for concurrent processing.

Strong standard library with network support.

Backed by Google and widely used in cloud-native applications.

4. Common Use Cases

Backend development for web applications.

REST APIs and microservices.

Cloud platforms, especially Kubernetes-based tools.

Networking services such as proxies and load balancers.

DevOps tools and command-line applications.

High-performance distributed systems.

5. Go Language Setup

Install Go from the official website (https://go.dev/dl
).

Confirm installation:

go version


Set workspace (usually ~/go).

Environment variables used:

GOPATH → workspace

GOROOT → Go installation directory

PATH → add /bin to system path

6. Basic Go Program Structure

Example:

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World")
}


Explanation:

package main is the entry package.

import loads other libraries.

main() is the starting function for execution.

Run:

go run main.go


Build:

go build main.go

7. Variables and Data Types

Syntax:

var name type = value


Example:

var age int = 25
name := "John"
isActive := true


Common Types:

int

float64

string

bool

rune

byte

arrays

slices

maps

structs

8. Constants
const PI = 3.14
const Country string = "India"

9. Control Statements
If Statement
if age > 18 {
    fmt.Println("Adult")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Minor")
}

For Loop
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

Switch
switch day {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
default:
    fmt.Println("Other Day")
}

10. Functions
func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}


Multiple return values:

func info() (string, int) {
    return "John", 25
}

11. Arrays and Slices
Array
var arr = [3]int{1, 2, 3}

Slice
nums := []int{10, 20, 30}


Slices are dynamic and used more than arrays.

12. Maps
students := map[string]int{
    "John": 21,
    "Amit":  22,
}

13. Structs
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

p := Person{Name: "Sam", Age: 30}

14. Methods
func (p Person) greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello", p.Name)
}

15. Interfaces
type Animal interface {
    Speak() string
}

16. Concurrency in Go

Go supports concurrency using goroutines and channels.

Goroutine
go myFunction()

Channel
ch := make(chan int)
ch <- 5
x := <-ch

17. Packages

Go uses packages to organize code.

Create package:

package utils


Use package:

import "myapp/utils"

18. Error Handling

Go does not use exceptions.

value, err := strconv.Atoi("123")
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error occurred")
}

19. File Handling
data, err := os.ReadFile("test.txt")
os.WriteFile("output.txt", []byte("Hello"), 0644)

20. Working With Modules

Start a module:

go mod init projectname


Download dependencies:

go get package-name

21. Building Web Servers

Using net/http package:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Welcome to Go Server")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

22. Testing in Go
go test


Example test file math_test.go:

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    result := Add(2, 3)
    if result != 5 {
        t.Errorf("Expected 5, got %v", result)
    }
}

23. Go Tools

go fmt → format code

go vet → check errors

go test → run tests

go mod → manage dependencies

go build → build executable

go run → run code

24. Advantages of Go

High performance

Simple and clean syntax

Automatic memory management

Perfect for concurrent systems

Strong tooling

Easy deployment with single binary output

25. Limitations of Go

No generics in older versions

Limited GUI support

Limited package ecosystem compared to JavaScript or Python

Error handling can feel repetitive
