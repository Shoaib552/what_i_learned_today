Simple definition

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that takes care of deployment, scaling, networking, and health of applications — automatically.

Think of it as an operating system for your backend infrastructure.

Real-life analogy

Imagine you have:

1 app

1000 users

Multiple servers

Instead of manually:

Starting apps

Restarting crashed apps

Distributing traffic

Kubernetes does all this for you.

Why Kubernetes is needed

Without Kubernetes:

You run apps manually on servers

Scaling is hard

Downtime when app crashes

With Kubernetes:

Auto-restart failed apps

Auto-scale when traffic increases

Load balancing

Zero-downtime deployments

Core concepts (must know)
1. Container

A packaged app + dependencies (Docker)

2. Pod

Smallest unit in Kubernetes

Runs one or more containers

3. Node

A machine (VM or physical server)

Runs pods

4. Cluster

Group of nodes

Managed by Kubernetes

5. Deployment

Defines how many copies of your app should run

Handles rolling updates

6. Service

Exposes your app to the network

Load balances traffic

How request flows (simple)
User → Service → Pod → Container → App

Example scenario

You deploy a web app with:

2 pods initially

Traffic increases

Kubernetes automatically:

Scales to 10 pods

Distributes traffic evenly

Kubernetes vs Docker (important)
Docker	Kubernetes
Creates containers	Manages containers
Runs on one machine	Runs on many machines
No auto-scaling	Auto-scaling
Manual restarts	Auto-healing

👉 Docker runs containers
👉 Kubernetes orchestrates them

Where Kubernetes is used

Large production systems

Microservices architecture

High-traffic apps

Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Interview one-liner

“Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.”
