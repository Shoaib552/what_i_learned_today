A ZIP file packs multiple files into one smaller file, making it easier to store, send, or download.

Easy example:

Instead of sending 10 separate files, you put them all into one ZIP file and share that single file.

Why ZIP files are used:

Reduce file size

Combine many files into one

Faster uploading and downloading

Easy to share by email or online

One-line definition:

A ZIP file is a compressed folder that holds multiple files in a smaller size.
