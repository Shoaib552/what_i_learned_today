Rate Limiter – Simple Notes

1. What is a Rate Limiter?

A rate limiter is a system that controls how many requests a user, IP, or system can make within a specific time.

Example: allowing only 100 requests per minute.

2. Why is Rate Limiting Used?

To prevent abuse, like bots hitting servers too fast.

To protect the server from high traffic or attacks.

To make sure all users get fair access to the system.

3. How a Rate Limiter Works

It counts how many requests a user makes.

If the number goes above the limit, the system:

stops the request, or

shows an error like "Too Many Requests".

4. Common Rate Limiting Methods

4.1 Fixed Window

Limits requests in a fixed time window (example: 100 requests per minute).

4.2 Sliding Window

More accurate counting over rolling time periods.

4.3 Token Bucket

User gets “tokens” (requests) that refill over time.

4.4 Leaky Bucket

Requests are processed at a steady rate, preventing spikes.

5. What Happens When Limit is Exceeded?

User receives 429 – Too Many Requests.

The system may:

block further requests

ask to wait

show CAPTCHA

slow down the response

6. Where Rate Limiters Are Used?

APIs

Websites

Login systems

Scraping tools

Cloud services

Messaging systems

7. Benefits of Rate Limiting

Protects the system from overload.

Stops brute-force attacks.

Reduces spam and bot activity.

Improves performance and stability.

8. Challenges in Rate Limiting

Hard to manage for global users.

Requires caching or fast storage.

Needs tune-up based on traffic patterns.

9. Tools That Provide Rate Limiting

Nginx

Cloudflare

AWS API Gateway

Express.js middleware
