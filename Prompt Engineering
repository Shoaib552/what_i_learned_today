Prompt engineering = the skill of talking to AI in a smart way so it gives you better, more accurate results.

Think of AI like a very powerful but very literal intern.

If you give clear instructions → great output

If you give vague instructions → confusing output

So prompt engineering is how you ask, not just what you ask.
